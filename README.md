# Grab Music from Youtube

## TODO

- [ ] automate downloads
    - [ ] use cronjobs / run everytime the url repository's timestamp is updated, ie, a new song request is made by adding the youtube url to the repository file.
- [ ] add nice generic artwork to the downloaded mp3s
- [ ] add them to my soundcloud
